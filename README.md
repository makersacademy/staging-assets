# Makers CDN for image assets

All of the images used across Makers Academy websites in one repo and served via GitHub pages to http://assets.makersacademy.com

Please add images into the **images** directory and make sure images are compressed using [image optim](https://imageoptim.com/) and are good quality images that fit the look and feel of the site.
